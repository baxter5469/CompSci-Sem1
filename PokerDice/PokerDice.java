/*
 * PokerDice.java
 *
 *   A program that plays and scores a round of the game Poker Dice.  In this game,
 *   five dice are rolled.  The player is allowed to select a number of those five dice
 *   to re-roll.  The dice are re-rolled and then scored as if they were a poker hand.
 *   The following hands MUST be scored in this assignment:
 *   	* High card
 *   	* One Pair
 *   	* Two Pair
 *   	* Three of a Kind
 *   	* Full House
 *   	* Four of a Kind
 *   	* Five of a Kind
 *   For an extra challenge, you may also implement:
 *   	* Straight
